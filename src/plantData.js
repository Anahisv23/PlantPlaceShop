    description:
      "Ficus elastica, also known as the rubber plant, is an unusual-looking varietal native to the tropics of Southeast Asia. This long-lived plant boasts oversized, oval-shaped leaves with a rich emerald hue and can grow quickly, reaching up to 100 feet tall in its natural habitat. It's not the easiest plant for beginners because it's not very forgiving if it doesn't get the care it needs. However, it's more often grown indoors as a houseplant, where it can be planted and cared for year-round, and its size is kept more manageable.",
